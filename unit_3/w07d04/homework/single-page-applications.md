1. What is a Single-Page application (SPA)? You only load the application code once, and when you interact with the application, instead of JavaScript making a new request to the server, the client requests some JSON or performs an action on the server. The page that the user sees is never completely wiped away.

2. What is Multi-Page Application? MPA's consists of several pages with static information (text, images, etc) and links to the other pages with the same content. During a jump to another page, a browser reloads the content of a page completely and downloads all resources again, even the components which are repeated throughout all pages.

3. When we built our Unit 2 apps, were they a SPA or MPA, why? I'm not sure.

4. Give two pros of SPA. SPA is fast since HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are only loaded once throughout the lifespan of the application. It's easier to make a mobile application because the developer can reuse the same backend code for web apps and native mobile apps.

5. Give two cons of SPA. It's not easy making SEO optimization of a SPA. Memory leaks in JavaScript can cause systems to slow down.

6. Give two pros of MPA. Good for SEO management. The simplicity of building static pages and small websites.

7. Give two cons of MPA. More difficult to develop than SPA's. Low flexibility and difficulty with adding dynamics.

1. What were the three great technical accomplishments of MPL? They understood the infrastructure of the site and could resolve small issues as they arose. It built App2, which signed up new users in less than half the time of the original app. It replaced the website's login system with a functional and less expensive one that they designed.

2. What does API stand for? Application Programming Interface

3. What is an API? A way to programmatically interact with a separate software component or resource.
